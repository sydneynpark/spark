# Hello world!

Hi everybody. My name is Sydney Park. I don't have a lot to say, so I'm not sure why I started a blog. Mostly to post photos of birds or something. Well I hope you like birds because that's probably all that will be here on this website.

My blog post preview takes the first 200 characters. Have I typed 200 characters yet? I don't know. I could easily find out by selecting the text that I've typed and seeing how many characters my editor says I've selected, but that would involve moving my hand from the keyboard to the mouse.

Good news, I have written way more than two hundred characters.
